#### Problem 23

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an M by N matrix consisting of booleans that represents a board. Each True boolean represents a wall. Each False boolean represents a tile you can walk on.

Given this matrix, a start coordinate, and an end coordinate, return the minimum number of steps required to reach the end coordinate from the start. If there is no possible path, then return null. You can move up, left, down, and right. You cannot move through walls. You cannot wrap around the edges of the board.

For example, given the following board:

```
[[f, f, f, f],
 [t, t, f, t],
 [f, f, f, f],
 [f, f, f, f]]
```

and start = (3, 0) (bottom left) and end = (0, 0) (top left), the minimum number of steps required to reach the end is 7, since we would need to go through (1, 2) because there is a wall everywhere else on the second row.

#### Problem 30

Problem 30
You are given an array of non-negative integers that represents a two-dimensional elevation map where each element is unit-width wall and the integer is the height. Suppose it will rain and all spots between two walls get filled up.

Compute how many units of water remain trapped on the map in O(N) time and O(1) space.

For example, given the input [2, 1, 2], we can hold 1 unit of water in the middle.

Given the input [3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 5], we can hold 3 units in the first index, 2 in the second, and 3 in the fourth index (we cannot hold 5 since it would run off to the left), so we can trap 8 units of water.

#### Problem 68

This problem was asked by Google.

On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal. This includes bishops that have another bishop located between them, i.e. bishops can attack through pieces.

You are given N bishops, represented as (row, column) tuples on a M by M chessboard. Write a function to count the number of pairs of bishops that attack each other. The ordering of the pair doesn't matter: (1, 2) is considered the same as (2, 1).

For example, given M = 5 and the list of bishops:

(0, 0)
(1, 2)
(2, 2)
(4, 0)
The board would look like this:

[b 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 b 0 0]
[0 0 b 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
[b 0 0 0 0]
You should return 2, since bishops 1 and 3 attack each other, as well as bishops 3 and 4.

#### Problem 86
This problem was asked by Google.

Given a string of parentheses, write a function to compute the minimum number of parentheses to be removed to make the string valid (i.e. each open parenthesis is eventually closed).

For example, given the string "()())()", you should return 1. Given the string ")(", you should return 2, since we must remove all of them.

#### Problem 175

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given a starting state start, a list of transition probabilities for a Markov chain, and a number of steps num_steps. Run the Markov chain starting from start for num_steps and compute the number of times we visited each state.

For example, given the starting state a, number of steps 5000, and the following transition probabilities:

One instance of running this Markov chain might produce {'a': 3012, 'b': 1656, 'c': 332 }.

#### Problem 176
This problem was asked by Bloomberg.

Determine whether there exists a one-to-one character mapping from one string s1 to another s2.

For example, given s1 = abc and s2 = bcd, return true since we can map a to b, b to c, and c to d.

Given s1 = foo and s2 = bar, return false since the o cannot map to two characters.

#### Problem 178

This problem was asked by Two Sigma.

Alice wants to join her school's Probability Student Club. Membership dues are computed via one of two simple probabilistic games.

The first game: roll a die repeatedly. Stop rolling once you get a five followed by a six. Your number of rolls is the amount you pay, in dollars.

The second game: same, except that the stopping condition is a five followed by a five.

Which of the two games should Alice elect to play? Does it even matter? Write a program to simulate the two games and calculate their expected value.

#### Problem 185
This problem was asked by Google.

Given two rectangles on a 2D graph, return the area of their intersection. If the rectangles don't intersect, return 0.

For example, given the following rectangles:

{
    "top_left": (1, 4),
    "dimensions": (3, 3) # width, height
}
and

{
    "top_left": (0, 5),
    "dimensions" (4, 3) # width, height
}
return 6.

#### Problem 187
This problem was asked by Google.

You are given given a list of rectangles represented by min and max x- and y-coordinates. Compute whether or not a pair of rectangles overlap each other. If one rectangle completely covers another, it is considered overlapping.

For example, given the following rectangles:

{
    "top_left": (1, 4),
    "dimensions": (3, 3) # width, height
},
{
    "top_left": (-1, 3),
    "dimensions": (2, 1)
},
{
    "top_left": (0, 5),
    "dimensions": (4, 3)
}
return true as the first and third rectangle overlap each other.

#### Problem 199

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a string of parentheses, find the balanced string that can be produced from it using the minimum number of insertions and deletions. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

For example, given `"(()"`, you could return `"(())"`. Given `"))()("`, you could return `"()()()()"`.


#### Problem 206
This problem was asked by Twitter.

A permutation can be specified by an array P, where P[i] represents the location of the element at i in the permutation. For example, [2, 1, 0] represents the permutation where elements at the index 0 and 2 are swapped.

Given an array and a permutation, apply the permutation to the array. For example, given the array ["a", "b", "c"] and the permutation [2, 1, 0], return ["c", "b", "a"].

#### Problem 212
This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Spreadsheets often use this alphabetical encoding for its columns: "A", "B", "C", ..., "AA", "AB", ..., "ZZ", "AAA", "AAB", ....

Given a column number, return its alphabetical column id. For example, given 1, return "A". Given 27, return "AA".


#### Problem 213

This problem was asked by Snapchat.

Given a string of digits, generate all possible valid IP address combinations.

IP addresses must follow the format `A.B.C.D`, where `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are numbers between `0` and `255`. Zero-prefixed numbers, such as `01` and `065`, are not allowed, except for `0` itself.

For example, given "2542540123", you should return `['254.25.40.123', '254.254.0.123']`.


#### Problem 214

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given an integer `n`, return the length of the longest consecutive run of `1`s in its binary representation.

For example, given `156`, you should return `3`.

#### Problem 215

This problem was asked by Yelp.

The horizontal distance of a binary tree node describes how far left or right the node will be when the tree is printed out.

More rigorously, we can define it as follows:
* The horizontal distance of the root is `0`.
* The horizontal distance of a left child is `hd(parent) - 1`.
* The horizontal distance of a right child is `hd(parent) + 1`.

For example, for the following tree, `hd(1) = -2`, and `hd(6) = 0`.

```
             5
          /     \
        3         7
      /  \      /   \
    1     4    6     9
   /                /
  0                8
```
  
The bottom view of a tree, then, consists of the lowest node at each horizontal distance. If there are two nodes at the same depth and horizontal distance, either is acceptable.

For this tree, for example, the bottom view could be `[0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9]`.

Given the root to a binary tree, return its bottom view.
